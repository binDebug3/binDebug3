### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior in the Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME) at Brigham Young University. I love to use computer science and math to understand the world around me, make predictions, and solve problems. In my free time I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and all kinds of board games.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a virtual assistant I've named Lila for my personal computer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about advanced algorithms for neural nets, dynamic models, and control theory
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ACME!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent a year living in the middle of Mexico
